# Appropriate Solutions for All

## Sookie Cho, DH110 UX+UI design, 2022 Fall

### Design statement
Oceans are essential to the existence of humans as we rely on them for food, water, energy, and climate regulation. In spite of this, human activity causes severe damage towards oceanic ecosystems. For our survival, we need to take care of and protect our precious resources. However, before we can even begin to do that, it is important to catch people's attention and spark interest in caring for marine life and our oceans. Then, we can collectively make a difference in ways like controlling pollution and overfishing. Thus, my project aims to utilize design practices and user-research methods to create a user experience that educates and persuades young-adults to care for life under the sea. 

### Research
I conducted Heuristic Evaluation of DHI Group and Marine Conservation Institute to understand the current ux issues of the website related the topic. See more about [heuristic evaluation](https://github.com/blerdwor/F22-DGT-HUM-110/blob/main/Assignment01.md).
